   <h2>Project tasks: üë©‚Äçüíª</h2>
     In these projects, I'll use the skills I've acquired in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to tackle a real-world data science problem. Through this, I'll practice key data science skills like exploratory data analysis, including tasks such as manipulating raw data and generating insightful plots with tools like pandas and matplotlib

<h3>Steps to complete</h3>

1 ==> Filter the data for movies released in the 1990s </br>
2 ==> Find the most frequent movie duration </br>
3 ==> Count the number of short action movies from the 1990s </br>
